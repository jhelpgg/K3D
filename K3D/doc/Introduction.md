# Introduction

Package presentation
--------------------

This **package** is *dedicated* to a 3D-engine to show 3D scenes.

It is a scene graph based on LWJGL: 
* The 3D is rendered by OpenGL (via LWJGL binding)
* Sounds by OpenAL (via LWJGL binding) 
* MP3 are decoded via JavaZoom
* The window it self, key/mouse/joystick managed with GLFW (via LWJGL binding)

**Note:** GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a window, creating an OpenGL context and managing input

Aim of this tutorials
---------------------

The goal of those tutorials is to explain how to use the 3D-engine.
We try by simple examples to show the different possibility of the 3D-engine.
We hope to give you the desire to go further in 3D.
